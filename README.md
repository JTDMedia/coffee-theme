## Installing

Note: Coffee doesn't actively support plugins (as in, we don't seek out and actively theme fixes to every new plugin). However, when a plugin is widely used, we try our best to stay compatible.

**For BD and Vencord:**

Download the theme file from github and move it into your injector's themes folder:

- BetterDiscord: `%appdata%\betterdiscord\themes`
- Vencord: `%appdata%\vencord\themes`
